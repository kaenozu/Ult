# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Overview

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**

## Red-Green-Refactor

1. **RED**: Write failing test.
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass.
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up.

## The Iron Law

NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST.
