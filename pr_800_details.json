I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\nThis pull request streamlines the `RiskSettingsPanel` by replacing custom toggle button implementations with a standardized `ToggleSwitch` component. This change significantly enhances code maintainability and ensures a consistent, accessible user experience throughout the application, particularly regarding ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation. The `ToggleSwitch` component itself was also updated to be more flexible by accepting standard HTML button attributes.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **Refactor RiskSettingsPanel**: The `RiskSettingsPanel` component was refactored to replace custom toggle button implementations with the reusable `ToggleSwitch` component.\n* **Improved Accessibility and Maintainability**: This change enhances code maintainability and ensures consistent accessibility features, including ARIA labels and keyboard focus, across the application.\n* **ToggleSwitch Enhancement**: The `ToggleSwitch` component was enhanced to support standard HTML attributes, making it more flexible and reusable.\n\n🧠 **New Feature in Public Preview:** You can now enable **Memory** to help **Gemini Code Assist** learn from your team's feedback. This makes future code reviews more consistent and personalized to your project's style. **Click [here](https://codeassist.google/code-review/login) to enable Memory in your admin console.**\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Changelog</b></summary>\n\n* **trading-platform/app/components/RiskSettingsPanel.tsx**\n    * Imported the `ToggleSwitch` component.\n    * Replaced three instances of custom toggle button logic with the `ToggleSwitch` component for 'Trailing Stop', 'Volatility Adjustment', and 'Kelly-based Position Sizing'.\n* **trading-platform/app/components/ui/ToggleSwitch.tsx**\n    * Modified the `ToggleSwitchProps` interface to extend `React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>`, allowing the component to accept standard HTML button properties.\n    * Removed explicit `disabled`, `aria-label`, and `className` props from the interface as they are now covered by the extended attributes.\n    * Updated the component's function signature to destructure `...props`, ensuring all standard HTML attributes are passed down to the underlying button element.\n* **verification/verify_order_panel.py**\n    * Removed the Python Playwright verification script for the order panel.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Activity</b></summary>\n\n* The pull request was automatically generated by Jules for a task initiated by @kaenozu.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point by creating a comment using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.

The enhancement to `ToggleSwitch` to accept standard HTML attributes is a solid improvement for accessibility and reusability. However, the removal of the Playwright E2E test script `verification/verify_order_panel.py` is a concern as it may leave a gap in the visual and integration testing coverage for the order panel.\n\n<details>\n<summary>I am having trouble creating individual review comments. Click here to see my feedback.</summary>\n\n### verification/verify_order_panel.py (1-53)\n\n![high](https://www.gstatic.com/codereviewagent/high-priority.svg)\n\nThe removal of this Playwright script (`verify_order_panel.py`) eliminates an important end-to-end visual regression test for the order panel. This creates a gap in testing coverage, as unit tests do not cover the component's final integrated appearance and behavior in a browser. This E2E test should be restored and updated to align with the component changes, or replaced with an equivalent E2E test.\n\n</details>","submittedAt":"2026-02-14T08:50:15Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"cd17da9ac07cafe51d4f36fdf83d186e1ed229d6"}}]}
