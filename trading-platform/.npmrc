# NPM Configuration - Security Best Practices

# Always create package-lock.json
package-lock=true

# Save exact versions (not ^ or ~) for better security
save-exact=true

# Audit level - fail on high and critical vulnerabilities
audit-level=high

# Automatically run audit after install
audit=true

# Use npm ci in CI/CD environments (this is a reminder, not a config)
# npm ci should be used in CI/CD pipelines instead of npm install
