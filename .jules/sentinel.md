## 2026-02-19 - IP Spoofing via Cloudflare Headers
**Vulnerability:** The application blindly trusted the `CF-Connecting-IP` header regardless of the `TRUST_PROXY` configuration. This allowed attackers to bypass rate limiting by spoofing their IP address if they could access the server directly (bypassing Cloudflare).
**Learning:** Developers often assume `CF-Connecting-IP` is safe because it's "immutable on Cloudflare", forgetting that it can be forged if the request doesn't come from Cloudflare.
**Prevention:** Always wrap proxy header checks (including vendor-specific ones like `CF-Connecting-IP`) inside a configuration check (like `TRUST_PROXY`) to ensure the application only trusts upstream information when explicitly configured to do so.
