## 2026-02-24 - [MACD Performance & Bug Fix]
**Learning:** Generic `calculateEMA` utilities often enforce `price >= 0` (for financial data correctness), but derived indicators like MACD (Fast EMA - Slow EMA) can be negative. Reusing `calculateEMA` for the MACD Signal line caused the signal to vanish when MACD dipped below zero.
**Action:** For derived indicators, use specialized inline calculations or validation logic that permits negative values, rather than reusing strict price-based utilities. Single-pass implementation also yielded a 50% performance boost by avoiding intermediate array allocations.
