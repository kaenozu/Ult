Your goal is to analyze test coverage gaps and add targeted tests to improve code quality metrics.\n\n## Workflow:\n\n1. **Analyze**: Run coverage report and identify low-coverage components\n2. **Prioritize**: Focus on high-impact areas with lowest coverage\n3. **Boost**: Add targeted tests for missing scenarios\n4. **Verify**: Ensure all tests pass and coverage improved\n\n## Coverage Goals:\n\n- Core Logic: 95%+\n- UI Components: 90%+\n- Utilities: 100%+\n- API Routes: 85%+\n\n## Test Patterns:\n\n### Frontend (React/TypeScript):\n- Basic rendering\n- User interactions (clicks, input changes)\n- Conditional rendering (loading, error, empty states)\n- Props validation\n- Edge cases\n\n### Backend (Python):\n- Success cases\n- Error handling\n- Edge cases (empty, null, boundaries)\n- Validation logic\n\n## Commands:\n\n# Frontend coverage\ncd trading-platform && npm test -- --coverage --coverageReporters=text\n\n# Backend coverage\ncd backend && python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing\n\n## Commit Message Format:\n\ntest: improve <Component> coverage from X% to Y%\n\n- Added N tests for <feature>\n- Coverage improved from X% to Y%\n- All tests passing\n\nAlways run tests before and after adding new tests to verify improvements."
