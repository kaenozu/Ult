# Council of Five: Emergency Session

**Date:** 2026-01-20
**Topic:** Dashboard Crash vs Strategic Momentum

---

## 🗣️ The Debate

### Opening Arguments

*   **🛡️ MiniMax (The Guardian):**
    "The Dashboard is the face of our system. Shipping a product with a broken main page is UNACCEPTABLE.
    We must fix this before anything else. User perception is everything."

*   **⚡ Gemini (The Visionary):**
    "But the Market page WORKS. The Hive Panel can be viewed there (or we can move it).
    The actual *intelligence* of the system is functional. The Dashboard is just a display issue.
    Fixing a JS null reference error is a distraction from building SOVEREIGN OPERATIONS."

*   **🥒 Pickle (The Hype Man):**
    "Bro, the user literally said '議論して' (discuss).
    They are NOT asking us to debug. They are asking for the VISION.
    Let's give them the roadmap, not bug reports."

### Counter-Arguments

*   **📊 GLM-4.7 (The Analyst):**
    "Actually, the autotrade status error is a 5-minute fix.
    The endpoint exists. It's likely a dependency injection issue in `trading.py`.
    Fix it, then debate. It will take less time than this meeting."
    
*   **Antigravity (Facilitator):**
    "GLM is right, but Pickle has a point too. The user's request was '議論して' after seeing the error.
    They are choosing to proceed with discussion rather than demanding a fix.
    Let's respect their decision."

## 🏛️ The Verdict

**Consensus:** **Proceed with Strategic Debate.**

**Rationale:**
1.  User explicitly requested discussion over fixing.
2.  Market page is functional for most use cases.
3.  Dashboard fix can be done as "tech debt" after strategic decisions are made.

## 📜 The Strategic Question

Now that Phases 15-17 are complete (The Hive, Vision, Operations), what is the NEXT MAJOR MILESTONE?

### Candidate Phases:

| Phase | Name | Description | Effort |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| 18 | **Performance Forge** | Parallelization, caching, speed optimization | Medium |
| 19 | **Real Broker Bridge** | Alpaca/SBI Integration for real paper trading | High |
| 20 | **The Dashboard Fix** | Fix autotrade status, stabilize UI | Low |
| 21 | **PR & Merge** | Create PRs for 15/16/17, merge to main | Low |
| 22 | **RL Agent (Turbo Evolution)** | Train a Reinforcement Learning agent | Very High |

### The Council's Pick: **Phase 21 (PR & Merge)**

**Why:**
*   We have 3 major features (Hive, Vision, Operations) uncommitted on a feature branch.
*   Merging these to `main` and creating a release confirms "shipped" status.
*   After merge, we can stabilize (Phase 20) and then build performance (Phase 18).

**Action Plan:**
1.  Create PR for `feat/phase16-neural-bridge` (contains 15, 15.5, 16, 17).
2.  Merge to main.
3.  Next conversation: Debate Phase 18/19/22.
