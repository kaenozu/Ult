# 激論: 予測精度は本物か？ (Prediction Accuracy Debate)

## Round 1: The Reality Check (現状認識)

### 📊 GLM-4.7 (Logic)
> "Scientific Rigor is missing. Current accuracy > 60% is statistically improbable with only daily price data. It is likely **Overfitting**. We need 'Walk-Forward Analysis' to see the real numbers, which are probably around **51-53%**."

### 🛡️ MiniMax M2.1 (Safety)
> "I agree. If a model claims 70% accuracy, it is suspicious (Look-ahead bias). I prefer a system with **40% accuracy but 3:1 Risk/Reward ratio**. We should focus on 'Loss Prevention' (Iron Dome) rather than crystal ball guessing."

### 🥒 Big Pickle (Chaos)
> "You nerds are boring! The market is a casino. Accuracy is a myth. The only thing that matters is **Time in the Market** and **Momentum**. If the chart looks like a rocket, we buy. If it cries, we sell."

### 🏎️ Qwen (Speed)
> "Price history is fossil data. HFTs have already eaten the arbitrage. To get true Alpha (Accuracy), we need **Alternative Data**—Satellite imagery, Sentiment Analysis, Dark Pool data. We are fighting with wooden sticks against machine guns."

## Round 2: The Data Problem (Garbage In, Garbage Out)

### ⚔️ Synthesis
The debate highlights a critical flaw: **Input Data Poverty.**
-   Current Input: `Open, High, Low, Close, Volume` (Basic Technicals).
-   Limit: Technical Analysis alone is a zero-sum game.
-   Solution: We need **External Catalysts**.

## Round 3: The Improvement Plan (Antigravity's Verdict)

### ⚖️ Conclusion:
1.  **Accept Mediation:** Our LightGBM model is likely a "Coin Flip + Edge" (52-54%). Do not trust it blindly.
2.  **Alpha Source:** The "Earnings Hunter" (Phase 6) is a step in the right direction (News/Event based vs Pure Price).
3.  **Next Step:** Verify the model's *actual* performance using a **Confusion Matrix** on unseen data.

**Actionable Insight:**
-   Don't obsess over "Accuracy %".
-   Focus on **"Expectancy"** (Win Rate x Profit  - Loss Rate x Loss).
-   Implement **"News Shock Defense"** to filter out bad trades (Phase 7).
