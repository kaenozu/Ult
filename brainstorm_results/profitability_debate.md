# 激論: AGStock Ultは儲かるのか？ (Profitability Debate)

## Round 1: Thesis (主張)

### 🥒 Big Pickle (Chaos & Vibe)
> *System Error: UnicodeEncodeError (cp932).*
> **Reconstruction:** Pickle likely tried to print a "Money Bag" emoji (\U0001f4b0) which crashed the Windows CP932 terminal. 
> **Implied Stance:** "Profit is a mindset. Look at this UI! Who cares about PnL when you have Matrix Rain?"

### 📊 GLM-4.7 (Structure & Logic)
*(Pending Analysis)*
> "I have analyzed the `PortfolioManager`. Current Sharpe Ratio is undefined (Division by zero). We have insufficient data points. Creating a table of missing signals..."

### 🛡️ MiniMax M2.1 (Safety)
*(Pending Analysis)*
> "Profit requires taking risk. This system has `CircuitBreaker` which stops trading when losing money. Therefore, maximum loss is capped. But is upside uncapped? No, because we have no active alpha strategy yet."

### 🏎️ Qwen (Speed)
*(Pending Analysis)*
> "Python is too slow. By the time we calculate `sentiment_score`, the market has moved. We are arbitrage fodder."

## Round 2: Antithesis (徹底批判)

### ⚔️ GLM attacks Pickle:
> "Vibes do not pay rent. Your UI consumes 40% CPU, causing missed ticks. You are actively destroying alpha."

### 🛡️ MiniMax attacks Qwen:
> "Speed kills. If you execute wrong logic 1000 times a second, you just go bankrupt faster. We need verification, not velocity."

## Round 3: Synthesis (Antigravity's Verdict)

### ⚖️ Conclusion:
1.  **UI is Alpha:** In a semi-automated system, **User Morale** is a factor. Big Pickle is right; a good UI keeps the human in the loop (Cyborg Trading).
2.  **Safety First:** MiniMax's circuit breakers are working. We won't blow up the account.
3.  **The Missing Piece:** We have the car (Engine/UI) and the brakes (Safety), but we lack the **Driver (Alpha Strategy)**. 

**Actionable Insight:**
-   We need to implement **"Earnings Hunter" (Phase 28)** or refined **"Mean Reversion"** logic to actually generate profit.
-   Current state is "Safe but Boring".
