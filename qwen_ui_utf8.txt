Holographic Market Visualization Dashboard\n- **Feature**: A 3D holographic-style market visualization showing price movements as glowing particle streams flowing through a neon grid\n- **Cyberpunk Elements**: \n  - Glowing cyan/magenta color scheme with dark backgrounds\n  - Animated particle effects representing trade volumes\n  - Floating holographic panels showing real-time data\n  - Grid lines reminiscent of TRON interfaces\n- **Engagement Factor**: Users can rotate and zoom the 3D view, creating an immersive trading experience that feels like being inside a futuristic trading floor\n\n### 2. Neural Network Trade Prediction Matrix\n- **Feature**: A dynamic neural network visualization that shows how different market factors interconnect and predict price movements\n- **Cyberpunk Elements**:\n  - Synaptic connection animations between different market indicators\n  - Pulsing nodes representing market sentiment\n  - Matrix-style falling numbers in the background\n  - Real-time prediction confidence levels displayed as \"neural firing\" rates\n- **Engagement Factor**: Traders can interact with the network to see how changing variables affect predictions, gamifying the decision-making process\n\n### 3. Augmented Reality Position Scanner\n- **Feature**: An AR-style overlay that scans positions and highlights risk/opportunity zones with cybernetic visual cues\n- **Cyberpunk Elements**:\n  - Reticle-style targeting system with beeping sounds\n  - Overlays showing \"scanned\" position data in digital font\n  - Risk levels visualized as heat signatures (red = danger, blue = safe)\n  - HUD elements similar to FPS games but for financial data\n- **Engagement Factor**: Creates a tactical feel to position management, making risk assessment more intuitive and engaging\n\nThese features would leverage modern WebGL capabilities, CSS animations, and interactive data visualization to create a truly unique trading experience that stands out in the fintech space.\n\nI'll now call the exit_plan_mode tool to present this plan for approval:\n\nI apologize for the confusion. Since we're in plan mode, I won't make any changes yet. Here are the 3 innovative 'Wow' factor frontend features for the Ult trading app with Cyberpunk aesthetics:\n\n## 3 Innovative Cyberpunk Trading Features\n\n### 1.
